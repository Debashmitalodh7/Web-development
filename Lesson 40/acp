         <p>
            Chinese cuisine is incredibly diverse, characterized by a wide variety of regional styles and ancient traditions. It
            features staples like rice, soy sauce, noodles, and tofu, and is known for its emphasis on balancing five flavors:
            sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and spicy. Due to China's vast geography, cuisines vary significantly by region, with
            different staples (like wheat in the north and rice in the south) and local ingredients shaping distinct cooking methodsand flavor profiles

        Pizza is an Italian dish of a flattened, leavened bread dough topped with sauce, cheese, and other ingredients,
        baked at
        a high temperature. Originating in Naples, Italy, the modern pizza emerged in the 18th century and became popular
        worldwide after Italian immigrants brought it to the United States. Variations exist globally, with the toppings and
        crust style differing by region.

        Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
        dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
        oven.
    
        The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in
        Lazio, on
        the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in
        Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
        2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish.
        In
        2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]
