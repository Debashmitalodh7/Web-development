        Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an internet (a private network).It's a process of building and maintaining websites and web applications, encompassing everything from
        the visual design to the behind-the-scenes functionality. It's broadly divided into front-end development (what the user
        sees and interacts with) and back-end development (server-side logic and database management). Key technologies include
        HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

    Pizza is an Italian dish of a flattened, leavened bread dough topped with sauce, cheese, and other ingredients,
    baked at
    a high temperature. Originating in Naples, Italy, the modern pizza emerged in the 18th century and became popular
    worldwide after Italian immigrants brought it to the United States. Variations exist globally, with the toppings and
    crust style differing by region.

<p>Pizza</p>

    Pizza[a][1] is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
    dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
    oven.

    The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in
    Lazio, on
    the border with Campania.[2] Raffaele Esposito is often credited for creating the modern pizza in
    Naples.[3][4][5][6] In
    2009, Neapolitan pizza[7] was registered with the European Union as a traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) dish.
    In
    2017, the art of making Neapolitan pizza was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.[8]
